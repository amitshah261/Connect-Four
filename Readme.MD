# Connect Four

Connect Four is a single / two-player connection game in which the players first choose a gamepiece and then take turns dropping their game pieces from the top into a twenty-five-column ( decreasing by two as we go downwards), nine-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own gamepieces of the same shape next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent. This is a slight variation of the original game.

In a single player game the player will play vs a Computer.

# Instructions:

1. Choose the game type (1 for single player, 2 for multiplayer).
 
2. Start by selecting your name and Game piece followed by the second player or computer doing the same.

3. Choose a column where you want to put your gamepiece.

4. Connect four to win the Game!
